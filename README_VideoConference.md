Code is for a video conferencing application using the VidStream library in Python

1. brew install portaudio
2. Install the VidStream library by running pip install vidstream in your terminal or command prompt.
4. A graphical user interface (GUI) will open, showing several buttons labeled "Start Listening", "Start Camera Stream", "Start Screen Sharing", and "Start Audio Stream".
5. To start a video call, first enter the IP address of the person you want to call in the "Target IP" field. Then, click the "Start Listening" button to start the server and listen for incoming connections.
6. The other person should also run the code on their device and click the "Start Camera Stream" button to start streaming their camera feed to you.
7. You can also use the "Start Screen Sharing" and "Start Audio Stream" buttons to share your screen or stream audio to the other person.

video conferencing application that uses the vidstream library. The code imports the vidstream library, tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface, socket library for network communication, and threading library for parallel execution.

The code creates four objects of StreamingServer and AudioReceiver classes from the vidstream library to start the streaming server and to receive the audio stream. The IP address of the local machine is obtained using the socket library's gethostbyname() function.

Four threads are started to run the start_server() function for each of the four objects, which will enable the server to listen to incoming connections and start the stream.

The code also defines four functions start_camera_stream(), start_screen_sharing(), start_audio_stream() that start the video, screen sharing, and audio streaming, respectively, by creating objects of CameraClient, ScreenShareClient, and AudioSender classes from the vidstream library. Each of these functions also starts two threads that call the start_stream() function for the respective objects.

Finally, the code creates a graphical user interface using the tkinter library with four buttons that call each of the four functions to start the video conferencing features. The IP address of the target machine is taken as input using a Text widget, and a label is added to provide instructions. The main event loop is started with the window.mainloop() function.

This code is meant for educational purposes only and may not work perfectly in all situations. You should also make sure that you have permission to use the camera, microphone, and screen sharing features on your device, and that you are not violating any privacy laws.
